The Employment Learning Community has three key components:1. A Delphi panel will identify issues and emerging and promising practices that will inform the work of the ELC.2. Three to five communities of practice will be convened annually. Members will engage in time- limited but intensive work on issues that will support their state-level systems-change efforts, and lead to the development of products that can be used by other states.3. Five to ten states will be selected for more intensive engagement in the project. Each of these states will receive technical assistance to develop a state-level consortium that will assist in local employment systems change.The Institute for Community Inclusion at the University of Massachusetts Boston has been funded by the Administration on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities to lead the ELC. The project partners include TransCen and the National Association of State Directors of Developmental Disabilities Services.##State ConsortiumsThe ELC is requesting applications from states seeking to develop or enhance a state-level consortium focused on systems change that will lead to improved employment outcomes for individuals with IDD. Five to ten states will be selected in 2013. Each state will be expected to participate in the ELC for 24 months, with an option to re-apply at the end of the 24-month period.Each consortium must be led by either the state developmental disabilities (DD) agency or a state DD network partner (state council on developmental disabilities, state protection and advocacy agency, and/or one of the state’s University Centers for Excellence in Disabilities), and shall include at least one DD network partner. Consortiums should also include partners such as the state vocational rehabilitation agency, the state education agency, state labor agency, and state Medicaid agency as necessary to fulfill the systems change. States are strongly encouraged to also include providers and employers, as well as individuals with IDD and family members.States will be required to develop a memorandum of understanding (MOU) outlining roles and responsibilities. The MOU must show the state’s commitment to the consortium and engagement in the project. In year one, states will be expected to develop a strategic plan for employment with updates occurring annually.Each state will have an ELC liaison who will provide technical assistance to the consortium and facilitate peer learning across the project. States will have access to additional project staff who are subject matter experts for further assistance in targeted areas. States will be required to participate in a minimum of two time- limited communities of practice annually. Additionally, the ELC will provide online training to support the work of the consortiums. States will also be required to participate in one annual meeting.##Application ProcessStates are required to complete an online application.

Must our consortium focus solely on employment for individuals with IDD?****A.** The work of the consortium will need to have a clear and direct impact on individuals with IDD, promoting systems change in employment. Understanding that many states are considering cross-disability policies and initiatives, and that systems change may have cross-disability impact, the ELC will accept applications from consortiums that have a cross-disability membership. However, states are required to include in the consortium the state IDD agency and a DD network partner (state council on developmental disabilities, state protection and advocacy agency, and/or the state’s University Center for Excellence in Disabilities). Additionally, it is expected that individuals with IDD and family members be included as well.**Q. Please clarify what you mean by “state developmental disabilities agency.”****A:** Your state developmental disabilities agency is the state executive branch department that has responsibility for serving individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities who are receiving home and community-based Medicaid waiver services and other related home and community-based supports.**Q. How will our state benefit from participating in the Employment Learning Community?****A.** Your state will have access to technical assistance to support the development of your consortium and the development and implementation of your state’s plan. Technical assistance will be provided remotely. Consortium members will have the opportunity to participate in communities of practice targeting issues important to your state. You will also have access to webinars focusing on organizational development for consortia, as well as topical issues related to state priorities.**Q. Will we receive any funding to participate in this project?****A.** No. States will not receive funding.**Q. Our state participates in other employment-related projects such as the ODEP Employment First Community of Practice and/or the State Employment Leadership Network. Can we participate in the ELC as a state consortium?****A.** Yes, you can. We will ask you to explain in your application how your involvement in the ELC will compliment, and not duplicate, other ongoing efforts in your state.**Q. How does this project define a “community of practice”? What will be expected of our state in this process?****A.** The ELC communities of practice will engage in time-limited but intensive work on issues that will support their state-level systems-change efforts, and lead to the development of products that can be used by other states. The communities of practice will include a maximum of 15 members who have a strong interest in the topic and investment in developing a body of work that will inform their efforts advancing integrated employment in their state and others. They will share methods, tools, practices, and stories that can expand effective employment policies and practices.
