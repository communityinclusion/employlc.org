title: The Employment Learning Community - Improving Employment Systems and Services for Individuals with IDD
---
The Employment Learning Community (ELC) will assist states in improving systems and services to increase inclusive, competitive employment for individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD). The ELC has three key components:

</div>

1. A Delphi panel will identify issues and emerging and promising practices that will inform the work of the ELC.
2. Three to five communities of practice will be convened annually. Members will engage in time-limited but intensive work on issues that will support their state-level systems-change efforts, and lead to the development of products that can be used by other states.
3. Five to ten states will be selected for more intensive engagement in the project. Each of these states will receive technical assistance to develop a state-level consortium that will assist in local employment systems change.

Led by the Institute for Community Inclusion at the University of Massachusetts Boston, with funding from the Administration on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities, the project partners include TransCen and the National Association of State Directors of Developmental Disabilities Services.

##Delphi Panel
The Delphi panel will be comprised of national leaders in the field of employment for people with IDD. Members will include representatives of national employment systems-change initiatives, self-advocates with IDD, family members of people with IDD, local and state leaders, educators, service providers, and employers.
The panel will identify and consider issues and practices that emerge over the life of project, informing the work of the ELC communities of practice as well as the state-level consortiums.

##Communities of Practice
The ELC will convene two communities of practice in 2013, with three to five convened annually in subsequent years. The communities of practice will provide opportunities for peer-to-peer learning and technical assistance. In year one, the topics will be driven by the work of the Delphi panel, while in subsequent years these priorities will be supplemented by the experiences of the state consortiums.

The communities of practice will include a maximum of 15 members who have a strong interest in the topic and investment in developing a body of work that will inform their efforts advancing integrated employment
￼￼￼
in their state and others. They will share methods, tools, practices, and stories that can expand effective employment policies and practices.
Community of practice members will be drawn from the state-level systems-change states (see below), as well as from other national employment systems-change initiatives.

##State-Level Systems Change
Five to ten states will participate in the state-level systems change component of the ELC. These states will each develop and implement a consortium that will assist in local employment systems change. Each state will have an ELC liaison who will provide technical assistance to the consortium and facilitate peer learning across the project. States will have access to additional project staff who are subject matter experts for further assistance in targeted areas.

Additionally, the ELC will provide online training to support the work of the consortiums. Quarterly webinars will address topics that emerge from the Delphi panel, the communities of practice, and the consortiums themselves.

The application to participate in the state-level systems-change component of the project is available as of May 2013, and work with states will begin in 2013.
